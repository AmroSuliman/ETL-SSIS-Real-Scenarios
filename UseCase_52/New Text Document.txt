### ðŸ”‘ Best Practices for SSIS Performance

1. **Execute tasks in Parallel**

   * Running independent tasks simultaneously improves ETL throughput.

2. **Load only required columns from source**

   * Avoid selecting `SELECT *`; pull only the necessary fields.

3. **While using Flat File, use the correct data type**

   * Choosing the wrong data type can cause implicit conversions and slow performance.

4. **While using OLE DB Source, write SQL Command instead of table/view**

   * Fetch only filtered and transformed data at the database level to reduce data load.

5. **Do transformations at the source whenever possible**

   * Example: use SQL `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `CASE` before bringing data into SSIS to minimize in-memory transformations.

6. **Avoid Asynchronous Transformations where possible**

   * These transformations block or slow down data flow since they need to load entire sets before processing.

### âš¡ Types of Asynchronous Transformations

| **Semi-Blocking (Medium Performance Impact)** | **Fully Blocking (Slowest)** |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Data Mining Query                             | Aggregate                    |
| Merge                                         | Fuzzy Grouping               |
| Merge Join                                    | Fuzzy Lookup                 |
| Pivot                                         | Row Sampling                 |
| Unpivot                                       | Sort                         |
| Term Lookup                                   | Term Extraction              |
| Union All                                     |                              |

âœ… **Conclusion**: For better SSIS package performance, push transformations to the database, avoid blocking transformations, fetch only necessary data, and design packages to run in parallel.
